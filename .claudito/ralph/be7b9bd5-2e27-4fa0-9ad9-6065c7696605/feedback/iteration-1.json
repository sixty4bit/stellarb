  "feedback": "This is excellent foundational work that properly sets up the StellArb project according to the ROADMAP specifications. The implementation demonstrates a solid understanding of the requirements and establishes a strong technical foundation for the game.",
  "specificIssues": [
    "The Cradle special case (0,0,0) may not be fully implemented in the system generator - needs verification that it returns tutorial-specific properties",

    "Missing implementation of The Cradle tutorial system mentioned in Phase 1 requirements"
  ],
  "suggestedImprovements": [
    "Implement special handling for The Cradle (0,0,0) coordinates in SystemGenerator to return tutorial-specific properties",
    "Connect placeholder navigation links to their respective controllers",
    "Add basic tutorial quest system for Phase 1 implementation",
    "Consider adding basic error handling and validation to controllers",
    "Add some basic styling constants or CSS variables for the terminal color scheme"
