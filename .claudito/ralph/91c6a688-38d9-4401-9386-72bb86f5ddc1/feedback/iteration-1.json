  "feedback": "The worker has successfully completed the ROADMAP.md build task. The document is comprehensive, well-structured, and meets all the stated requirements. Key accomplishments include: 1) Complete consolidation of PRD content into the ROADMAP structure, 2) Addition of detailed success criteria for all major sections, 3) A comprehensive 18-screen UI specification with keyboard shortcuts, 4) A complete 6-phase implementation roadmap with clear deliverables and success gates, 5) Technical considerations with specific performance targets, 6) Fun calibration methodology for final tuning. The document is now a complete, agent-verifiable specification ready to guide StellArb development.",

  "suggestedImprovements": [
    "Consider adding version control or change tracking for the game balance parameters in Section 17 to track calibration history",
    "The implementation timeline assumes a 12-week development cycle - consider adding buffer time for unexpected complexities",
    "Some success criteria could benefit from more specific test commands (e.g., exact SQL queries for performance verification)"
