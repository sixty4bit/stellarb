# StellArb (Stellar Arbitrage)

A massive multiplayer online strategy game bridging the fast-paced trading of *Dope Wars* with the logistical depth of *Eve Online* — without the spreadsheet fatigue.

## Concept

- **Text-based CLI interface** — No 3D rendering, just commands and information
- **Procedural universe** — 10^18 coordinate grid, deterministic generation
- **Three gameplay layers:**
  - **Courier** (Active) — Manual piloting, scanning, market arbitrage
  - **Tycoon** (Strategic) — Automated fleets, maintenance, decay management
  - **Expedition** (Exploration) — Deep space discovery, monopoly rights

## Key Features

- 🚀 **Procedural ships & buildings** — ~200 ship hulls, ~100 building types across 4 races
- 👥 **NPC workforce** — Hire, manage, and lose crew with personality quirks
- 💰 **Dynamic economy** — Base prices from seed, only deltas stored
- 🐹 **The Pips** — Anti-AFK mechanic via adorable infestations
- 📬 **Actionable Inbox** — Dashboard with inline commands and racial humor
